You know it's going to be a rough session when your therapist brings out a whiteboard. It's moments like that in which I begin to question the wisdom of not only putting myself through this but actually PAYING money for it. Having your life, specifically your +10 year relationship/marraige, disected on a board in front of you is a powerful and surreal experience.

Deep introspection has always been a troublesim activity for me as I am rather slow to process the emotional aspect of things. Walking down such paths of reflection usually leave me in a mealoncholic state; however having a sarcastic, and annoyingly accurate, narrator for today's saunter into the dark recesses of the past did help cut through the bitterness. "You can't unsee what you have seen, no matter how much you may wish to." I said, staring at the now full white board. A particular movie quote comes to me at this moment "You see a lot don't you doctor. Why don't you turn that high-powered perception at yourself and tell us what you see, or, maybe you're afraid to." - Clarice Starling (Silence of the Lambs)

// Thinking back on the last ten years of my life makes me feel simeoultaneously ancient and like an entirely different entity.
